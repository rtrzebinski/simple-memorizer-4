The Simple Memorizer is an educational tool that utilizes the spaced repetition technique commonly employed with flashcards. It presents newly introduced and challenging exercises more often, while reducing the frequency of older and easier ones, taking advantage of the psychological spacing effect. Extensive research has confirmed that the implementation of spaced repetition significantly enhances the speed of learning.

This marks the fourth iteration of the project, incorporating the Go programming language for both the UI and backend components. It functions as a creative space for experimentation and a platform to showcase coding skills.
